## What we worked on
In this class we got into converting an HTML file into a theme. Using the index.html file shown we made a header.php, footer.php, index.php and added nav menus to functions.php

It isn't a complete transformation. We didn't have time to deal with the content or loop in index.php. The two articles in there will be removed and replaced with a WordPress Loop.
